# Smart-Irrigation-System-for-Optimal-Crop-Management

An IoT-powered system to automate and optimize crop irrigation using soil moisture sensors, water level monitoring, smart scheduling, real-time notifications, and a mobile app. Built with NodeMCU, Firebase, and GSM, the system aims to reduce water wastage, save labor, and improve agricultural efficiency.

üöÄ Features
Real-time soil moisture monitoring (4 lines)
Water tank level sensing
Three irrigation modes: Manual, Automatic, Optimal
Firebase Realtime Database for remote control
SMS alerts using GSM module (SIM800L)
LCD display for local status feedback
Scheduling system based on last irrigation date
Fertilizer recommendations and climate notifications
Data logging and visualization via ThingSpeak.
‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
Flash Arduino Code:

Upload NodeMCU_1_MainController.ino to the main NodeMCU.
Upload NodeMCU_2_GSM_LCD_Controller.ino to the second NodeMCU.
Also where ever you see long ---------- their you need to make changes
Setup Firebase:

Create a Firebase project and structure it based on firebase_structure.json/png in /Firebase_Config/.
Use the Mobile App:

Import Smart_Irrigation_System (2).aia into MIT App Inventor.
Replace Firebase API key with your api key
Power up: -Connect sensors, relays, and modules as per the circuit. -Ensure Wi-Fi credentials and Firebase API keys are correctly set in the Arduino code.
